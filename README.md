# Custom-E2E-IRC
Custom chatting platform with End-To-End encryption similar to regular IRC's. This project is open source designed to be anonymous and secure.

# Getting Started
To get started as a client you need to open the client directory and run ```client.py``` and you're good to go. You will need tkinter installed.

# TODO
* script doesn't stop when closing the tkinter window
* the project is messy and requires deep cleaning 
* need to add a .gitignore
